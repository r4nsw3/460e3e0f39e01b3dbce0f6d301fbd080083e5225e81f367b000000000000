    Saints Row: The Third - The Full Package gives you control of the 
    Saints at the height of their power, and you live the life to show for
    it.
    Put the wildest chapter of the Saints Row saga in the palms of your 
    hands for the first time on Nintendo Switch. You bring the fight to
    Steelport, a sordid city of sin. This is your City. These are your 
    rules.
    Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints 
    have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints
    sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobblehead dolls all
    available at a store near you. The Saints are kings of Stilwater, 
    but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a
    legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe,
    has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.
    Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport,
    a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under 
    Syndicate control. Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted
    airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and fight against a highly-
    trained military force by your lonesome in the most outlandish 
    gameplay scenarios ever seen.

    Features:
    - City of Sin - Disrupt and dismantle the Syndicate stranglehold on
      the world of organized crime. Discover the secrets of Steelport,
      where there is action on every street corner, for better or, more
      likely, worse.
    - Weapons of Crass Destruction – It is one thing to defeat your 
      enemies. It is another to humiliate them. Hover jets, human cannonball
      cars and other ludicrous weapons are all part of the fun.
    - Joy-Con Crazy Customisation – Create the most outlandish characters 
      every seen, from washed-up celebrities to naked ninja pirates. Inside
      every sinner, there is a Saint. Who will you become?
    - Portable Over The Top Co-op – Fly solo, or play online with a homie
      and for the first time – two players can play side to side via online
      or local multiplayer. Give naked skydiving a try, landing in your 
      partners flaming pickup as you make a suicide run toward a heavily 
      armed Syndicate business. Steelport is more fun with a friend.
    - The Full Package – Includes all three mission packs and more than 
      30 DLC items.
